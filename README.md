# CS 426: Assignment One

## Project Overview:
"A simple Ball Throwing-like game using Unity3D, while following loosely the Living in the City theme (you could use 3D objects to represent some characteristic elements of your city or neighborhood, change the projectiles to local fruits, and so on, anything that strikes your fancy). In general, go for pastel colors, not saturated primary colors."

----

## Minimum Requirements:

> - [x] Make sure the player character is visible at all times (you should use BB8, or one of the Unity assets, or some other model); “visible” means your camera is NOT collocated with BB8’s head, and that your camera SHOULD follow BB8/your player character as it moves about
> - [x] Make sure you have some form of ground and decor (e.g., trees would be nice; you may use the ones built into Unity)
> - [x] Make sure you have at least one colored light source
> - [x] Launch/Drop at least 5 “balls” from player controlled positions
> - [x] Your player character should not fall through the ground, or slide backwards as it shoots etc.
> - [x] “Balls” must move using Unity Physics
> - [x] There must be blocks or pegs (or some other obstacles) for the “balls” to hit; the balls should change course as they hit the obstacles
> - [x] There must be some walls for the balls to stay in bounds
> - [x] When the ball lands on specific locations, the player should receive a point value and the amount of points should be awarded visually (i.e., you should show a scoreboard)
> - [x] Game should display at least three  3D objects (including the BB8 character you’ve used in class)  and at least three 2D textures (a texture is just a flat, 2D image; work on your own with the Unity3D online tutorials to figure out how to use textures)

### Explanation:
This project satisfies these requirements, including the "Living in the City" theme previously mentioned by having a closed, playable area.  It also has several targets that the user should try to hit using the "Balls", of which both the balls and targets interact using Unity physics and which visually updates a scoreboard when successfully done.  There are several instances of 3D and 2D objects used in the scene, all relevant objects have colliders (like buildings and the ground), and the camera follows the player character in a 3rd-person manner.

## Assets/Code Attributions:

The assets used in this project mainly consist of the following two free packages from the Unity Asset Store:
> - [Demo City by Versatile Studios](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/urban/demo-city-by-versatile-studio-mobile-friendly-269772)
> - [Low Poly Street Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/urban/low-poly-street-pack-67475)
> - *(There was also minimal usage of the terrain tools (+ [sample asset](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/terrain-sample-asset-pack-145808)) package (by Unity) for the grass texture).*

Any code used was either from the code provided to our class, or made by me using things like online tutorials and forums.
